    <h1>Origin</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2005, a legend slowly took root. Our CEO, Mr. Gan Khai Boon, 
    had a strong interest in technology since he was a child. He was determined to use his abilities to benefit the world, So he 
    summoned his partners from all walks of life to complete his great cause. They are Chin Shun Yon, the professionals of Business 
    and Financial; Jed Tan Hou Jie, professionals of Research and Development; Yap Yan Cheng, profesionals of Human Resources 
    Management; Ng Lee Kai, professionals of Marketing</p>

    <h1>Why we named Black Pineapple</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Beside technology,Our CEO, Mr. Gan also interest in music especially admired a band from Hong Kong, Beyond
    He named the company by a song from Beyond, It is "喜欢你".
    In Cantonese the pronounce of "喜欢你" is "hei fun lei" same with pronounce of black pineapple.
    So, the company officially named Black PineApple to Pay tribute and remember the legendary Hong Kong band beyond.
    Mr. Gan, who has artistic talent, also designed a logo for the company.</p>

    <h1>Our Aims</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Just like the band "Beyond", our company takes original innovation as its selling point, and the word beyond represents transcendence.
    We not only want to surpass other companies in the same field, but also surpass ourselves, 
    continue to innovate in research and development of technology, and create low-priced but high-quality products.
    In addition, our goal is also to research phone cameras, 
    in order to capture and record every smile of people, just like the lyrics in "喜欢你".
    "喜欢你 那双眼动人 笑声更眯眼 愿在可 轻抚你 那可爱面容 挽手说梦话 像昨天 你共我"
    Translate — I like you. Those eyes are moving. Your laughter is even narrower. 
    I wish I could caress your lovely face. Holding hands and talking in sleep. It's like yesterday when you and I were together.
    In addition, we have also developed a powerful artificial intelligence called "Amani". The word "Amani" is the title of a song by Beyond, and the name of this song is "Amani".
    In the African Kiswahili language, it means peace. We hope this technology can benefit mankind and make everyone feel "Amani" (peaceful)
    and "Nakupenda" (love).
